What our app solves, and why we created it: Our app allows users to find current rock hounding spots around their state without relying on old forums. Many of the current rock hounding sites are outdated and can lead you to trails that are non existent now. With our website/app, users will be able to discuss where they found their rocks, which states, and have a discussion about them.

User Stories:
- The user will be able to login and create a password

- Once logged in, the user will be able to identify which state they are in, and click on the rock that is associated with the one they found

- Users will be able to add comments and pictures on the accessed state/rock, letting others know where they found the rock (What town, trail they used, etc)

- Users that are not logged in, will be able to see the map, as well as read the forum, but cannot post
