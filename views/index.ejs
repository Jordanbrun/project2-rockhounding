<h3>Our mission:</h3>
<p>Have you ever went on a rock hounding extravaganza, and followed the EXACT directions that a forum or book gave you... But you end up coming back empty handed? I know I have and thats why this website was created! This site was built to allow users to find the MOST current rock hounding spots around their state without relying on old forums. Many of the current rock hounding sites are outdated and can lead you to trails that are non existent. With our website, you will be able to discuss where you found the rocks, which state, and be able to interact with others about your adventure!.</p>
